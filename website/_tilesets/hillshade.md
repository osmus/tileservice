Terrain hillshade raster tiles. Derived from [Mapzen's global DEM dataset](https://registry.opendata.aws/terrain-tiles/), which combines data from [various open DEM datasets](https://github.com/tilezen/joerd/blob/master/docs/data-sources.md). Created using [GDAL](https://gdal.org/).

Ideal for outdoor recreation maps, and other maps where terrain context is important.
