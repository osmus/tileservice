<p>Tile Usage Policy for OpenStreetMap Americana Community Vector Tile Server</p>
<p><strong>Effective Date: June 12, 2023</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for using the OpenStreetMap Americana Community Vector Tile Server (referred to as &quot;the Server&quot;). By accessing and using the tiles provided by the Server, you agree to comply with the following Tile Usage Policy:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Purpose:
 The Server aims to support hobbyists, small community groups, and individuals who require vector tiles for their projects or development of custom map styles. The Server is a community resource provided at no cost, but limitations may apply based on server capacity and financial constraints.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Attribution:
When using tiles from the Server, you must provide proper attribution to OpenStreetMap and OpenMapTiles as required by their respective attribution policies.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Personal and Non-Commercial Use:
The Server is primarily intended for personal, non-commercial use. You are welcome to use the tiles for personal or community projects, educational purposes, or non-profit initiatives that do not generate revenue. There are several <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/ZeLonewolf/diary/401697">guides</a> available for commercial users that desire to run a vector tile server at low cost.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Domain Whitelisting:
Tile usage from localhost and *.github.io is permitted, which are common ways that most developers will access the tile server when starting a new project. If you wish to use the tiles under your own domain name, please contact the Americana team on <a href="https://osmus.slack.com/archives/C01V02K52UX">Slack</a> (preferred) or <a href="https://github.com/osm-americana/openstreetmap-americana">GitHub</a> and provide your domain name(s) in order to add your domain to the CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) white list. This will allow you to fetch tiles directly from your domain. This whitelist is subject to the discretion and may be modified or removed at any time, however, permission is routinely given for community and hobby projects.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Usage Limits:
To ensure fair usage and prevent abuse, the Server may enforce limits on tile requests for individual users or domains. If your usage exceeds reasonable levels or begins to strain the server&#39;s resources, the administrator reserves the right to restrict or terminate access to the Server. Users whose usage becomes excessive may be requested to set up their own tile server.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Financial Considerations:
The Server is operated on a limited budget and funded out of pocket by the administrator. While it strives to be freely accessible, financial constraints may necessitate restrictions on usage. If the costs associated with providing tiles become prohibitive, the administrator may need to limit or suspend service temporarily or permanently. Users who can afford to host their own tile server are encouraged to do so.</p>
</li>
<li><p>No Guarantees:
The Server is provided on an &quot;as-is&quot; basis, and no guarantees or warranties are offered regarding its availability, performance, or accuracy of the tiles. The administrator will make reasonable efforts to maintain the service, but interruptions or downtime may occur due to various factors beyond their control.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Modifications and Termination:
The administrator reserves the right to modify or terminate the Server or this Tile Usage Policy at any time without prior notice. The administrator may also modify or update the CORS white list as needed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Compliance with OpenStreetMap Guidelines:
All users of the Server are expected to comply with the OpenStreetMap licensing terms, guidelines, and community norms. Additionally, the OpenStreetMap Americana project has adopted the OpenStreetMap US Code of Conduct, which applies where applicable. Any violation of these terms may result in the immediate termination of access to the Server.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Feedback and Support:
The administrator appreciates feedback, bug reports, and suggestions to improve the Server via <a href="https://osmus.slack.com/archives/C01V02K52UX">Slack</a> or [GitHub]. However, support resources may be limited. Users are encouraged to seek assistance from the OpenStreetMap community or other relevant forums for additional support.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By using the tiles provided by the OpenStreetMap Americana Community Vector Tile Server, you acknowledge and agree to the terms outlined in this Tile Usage Policy. Failure to comply with these terms may result in the revocation of access to the Server.</p>
<p>Please note that this Tile Usage Policy is subject to change at any time and for any reason.</p>
